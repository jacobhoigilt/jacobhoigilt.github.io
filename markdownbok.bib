  abstract = {Die Schriftenreihe linguae \& litterae, herausgegeben von Peter Auer, Gesa von Essen und Werner Frick, dokumentiert die wissenschaftlichen Aktivit{\"a}ten der School of Language and Literature des Freiburg Institute for Advanced Studies (FRIAS) im Bereich einer theoretisch und methodisch avancierten, interdisziplin{\"a}r ge{\"o}ffneten Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaft. In der Linguistik liegt der Akzent auf der korpusbasierten, quantitativen und qualitativen Erforschung von Sprache, in der Literaturwissenschaft auf der komparatistisch-transdisziplin{\"a}ren Analyse literarischer Ph{\"a}nomene in ihren kulturellen Kontexten. Zugleich nimmt die Reihe die produktiven Kontakt- und Synergiezonen zwischen moderner Linguistik und Literaturwissenschaft (und den mit ihnen im Austausch stehenden Geistes-, Sozial- und Naturwissenschaften) in den Blick und sucht nach neuen, f{\"u}r die zeitgem{\"a}{\ss}e Reformulierung des humanwissenschaftlichen Forschungscurriculums richtungsweisenden Fragestellungen und Konzepten.  Die internationale Ausrichtung der Reihe findet ihren Ausdruck in der konsequenten Mehrsprachigkeit der B{\"a}nde, in denen deutsch-, englisch- und franz{\"o}sischsprachige Beitr{\"a}ge, ggf. auch Artikel in italienischer und spanischer Sprache erscheinen. Jeder Einzelband wird im Rahmen eines peer-review-Verfahrens durch ein international besetztes Editorial Board begutachtet. Pro Jahr erscheinen 2-4 B{\"a}nde.},

One of the countries that has been entrapped in conspiratorial visions is Turkey, and this book is the first comprehensive survey in English of the Turkish conspiratorial mind-set. It provides a nuanced overview of the discourses of Turkish conspiracy theorists and examines how these theorists argue for and legitimize their worldview. The author discusses a broad range of conspiracy theories, including some influenced by Kemalist and Islamist perspectives as well as those of the ruling Justice and Development Party. The most influential authors, books, references and images within the conspiracist milieu are all examined in detail.  This book will be an important source for scholars interested in extremism in Turkey and the societal and political impact of conspiracy theories.},

Placing conspiracy theories in their historical context, Pipes shows how they have come to suffuse life in the Middle East - from the most private family conversations to the highest and most public levels of politics. He then proceeds to examine conspiracism as a partial explanation for much of the region's problems, including its record of political extremism, violence, and lack of modernization. Concluding with speculations about the future of conspiracism, Pipes makes a very strong case that conspiracy theories are key to understanding the often complicated political culture of the Middle East. The Hidden Hand: Middle East Fears of Conspiracy is a book that anyone interested in the Middle East will want to read.},

  abstract = {This essay examines the proliferation of practices of conspiracy theorizing among Algerian citizens and expatriates in light of the current civil war that since 1992 has resulted in 100,000 deaths and an ongoing state of emergency disrupting nascent democratic legal and political processes. Seeking to provide transparent accounts of opaque military actions, Algerian conspiracy theorizing adopts a totalizing rhetoric that eschews uncertainty and fetishizes causality and actor intentionality. The article argues that such rhetoric outlines a shared political culture for Algerians across ethnic, linguistic, and ideological divides. While constituting a vernacular sphere of transnational knowledge production and circulation (a Foucauldian "regime of truth"), this political culture of conspiracy simultaneously provides a discursive prop for military and governmental structures of power whose coherence is otherwise placed in jeopardy by the civil war violence. What is at issue in the end is the role of social practices like conspiracy theorizing in dialectical structures of hegemonic processes December 1998, Paris. I have just returned to my field site after an 18 month absence. I phone my main "informant," Akli, a Kabyle activist who has lived in France for the last six years since fleeing the ongoing civil war in Algeria. He is working as a language teacher and hotel manager, and is married to a French-Kabyle woman with whom he has a small son. After standard greetings in Taqbaylit (Kabyle Berber) we switch to French. "So," he asks, "who killed Matoub?" referring to the July assassination of outspoken Kabyle folksinger and militant, Loun{\`e}s Matoub, while on a family visit to Algeria. Matoub had been nearly killed twice previously, first by an state policeman during the October 1988 nationwide demonstrations, and again when apparently kidnapped by an Islamist militia in 1994. (The details of both incidents, reported in Matoub's 1995 best-selling autobiography, had been widely doubted by his detractors). Matoub was also a friend and comrade of Akli. "The papers claimed he had been killed at a false roadblock, that the government has arrested several members of the GIA [Armed Islamic Group]," I reply simply. But Akli casts certain doubt: "Which newspapers? Do you believe them? Who knew he was going to be on that road, anyways? The question is: Who had the most to benefit." Akli then rehearses the political logic of a number of possible alternative scenario-the government wanting to eliminate a thorn in its side; Kabyle militants wanting to create a martyr-before espousing a conspiracy between military and Islamist forces. This thread of conversation continues for sometime, and I'm left wondering, what is Akli's interest in this conclusion? We end the phone call agreeing to meet in person and talk more.}
